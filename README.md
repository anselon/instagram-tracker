About: 

This application tracks hashtags on Instagram and creates collections of photos for each tag. This is the interface for the application built with Backbone and Node and hosted at https://blooming-waters-27559.herokuapp.com/. This interface lists the existing photo collections and creates a paginated gallery for each collection. 

I chose to use Backbone because I knew it had a built-in mechanism for handling collections being updated from a REST API. I am also currently working on the Rails applicaiton that includes a Postgres database for the tracking portion of the application.
